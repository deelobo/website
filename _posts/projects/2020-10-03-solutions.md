<br>
<p>A big part of my work involves engaging with diverse partners to deliver science that informs practice and policy for advancing conservation + equity.
<br>
<p>Here are some solutions I helped to bring about with amazing colleagues:<p>
<br>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
**Prints that support decision making**
<br>
1. The book "Implementando Reflorestamentos com Alta Diversidade na Zona da Mata Nordestina - Guia Prático" [Implementing restoration projects with high biodiversity in the Northeastern Atlantic Forest: a guidebook] offers land managers with little or no scientific background the "how-to" information they need to plan and implement restoration activities in the Northeastern Atlantic Forest. The book set forth a step-by-step process for selecting native species, implementing and monitoring on-the-ground restoration activities.
The cool thing, it also served as a normative standard to public policies in forest rehabilitation in several states in Northeast Brazil.
<br>
2. The book "Espécies Exóticas Invasoras no Nordeste do Brasil" [Invasive exotic species in Northeast Brazil]
br>
3. An identification guide of trees to support seedling production of the Nature Reserve Pedra D'Anta's restoration projects.
<br>
4. Restoration plan and assessment for the Suape's Industrial Port Complex, Pernambuco.
<br>
5. Restoration plan and assessment for the Nature Reserve Pedra D'anta (Lagoas dos Patos, PE, Brazil)
<br>
<br>
 **Training courses**
1. A 5-module training course in ecological restoration for land managers and environmental agencies.
<br>
2. A training course in Payment for Ecosystem Service (PES) with diverse stakeholders, including policymakers, in Pernambuco, Brazil. After the course, the state's policy draft on mechanisms to confront climate change (No. 14.090, signed on June 17, 2010) was revised to include the concept of ecosystem services and to promote reforestation with native species and PES as a form of compensation for forest conservation.</p>
