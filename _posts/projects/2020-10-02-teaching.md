<p>
 As a teacher, my goal is to prepare students to work on environmental problems and solutions in a complex and diverse world. I believe that teaching and learning approaches centered around the integration of disciplines and systems thinking are crucial to meet this goal.
<br>
<br>
My pedagogy focuses on helping students to master a set of complex skills, such as scientific literacy and communication, problem-solving, and conflict management, that equip them with critical ways to think about human-nature interactions holistically.
