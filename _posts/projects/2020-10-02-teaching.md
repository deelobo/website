Many of today’s global environmental problems can be traced back to deficiencies in education. The prevalence and predominance of reductionist approaches to environmental science education are examples of such deficiencies as they hinder students’ ability to understand and predict complex systems' behavior. Consequently, ill-informed decisions are pervasive and entrenched in our society, diminishing our capacity to enact the transformative changes society and nature urgently need. As a teacher, my goal is to prepare students to work on environmental problems and solutions in a complex and diverse world. I believe that teaching and learning approaches centered around the integration of disciplines and systems thinking are crucial to meet this goal.

My pedagogy focus on helping students to master a set of complex skills, such as scientific literacy and communication, problem-solving, and conflict management, that equip them with critical ways to think about human-nature interactions holistically.
