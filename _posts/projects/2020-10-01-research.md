<p>practice to conservation and putting forward a conceptual reference and research agenda to conservation entrepreneurship. I examine processes whereby sustainability-driven entrepreneurs can build rural communities' resilience to climate change in drought-prone areas in Northeast Brazil. Drylands cover about 40% of the land surface and are among the most sensitive areas to climate change and desertification. Like in many other tropical and subtropical regions, most rural communities in Brazil's drylands are extremely poor, rely on subsistence farming - a vulnerable livelihood to climate change, and live in places where formal institutions are absent or fail to accomplish the role expected of them. Using case study analysis and evidence synthesis, I demonstrate that the transformative capacity of entrepreneurship, well-known in the social sciences but vastly overlooked in conservation science, is a key driver for building community resilience to climate change in such places. Four manuscripts based on these findings will be soon submitted to the journals Conservation Biology, Conservation Science and Practice, and Journal of Enterprising Communities.
In previous work, I explored the long-term effects of habitat fragmentation on regional biodiversity. I applied data science techniques to build and analyze a database with 35K+ plant records to test whether the floras of the Northeastern coastal forest in Brazil has become more homogenous over time. The findings of this work expanded the understanding of drivers and processes of biotic homogenization to include habitat fragmentation and the spreading of native species. This work resulted in an article at Diversity and Distributions that is within the top 100 most cited publications of this journal. I also co-authored a meta-analysis that used random forest, a decision tree learning algorithm for data modeling, to identify economic and biological predictors of sustainable wild harvesting in developing countries. These findings were published at Ecological Economics.
Looking ahead, I will build upon my previous fieldwork by examining other forms of entrepreneurial agency and action for conservation and sustainability, such as institutional and technological entrepreneurship. I will also further expand my practice-driven research by engaging with ventures to build tools that help them prototype and scale conservation solutions. I plan to combine this research with my dissertation data to write a book manuscript in conservation entrepreneurship. I have begun two exciting collaborative projects examining disciplinary identity and culture of inclusion in conservation institutions and gendered innovations in entrepreneurship. I would welcome students interested in joining them. All these topics will constitute the cornerstone of my research agenda and publications over the next several years. Additionally, this trajectory would allow me to develop courses for the Department of Biology through the lens of social justice</p>
