<p>practice to conservation and putting forward a conceptual reference and research agenda to conservation entrepreneurship. I examine processes whereby sustainability-driven entrepreneurs can build rural communities' resilience to climate change in drought-prone areas in Northeast Brazil. Drylands cover about 40% of the land surface and are among the most sensitive areas to climate change and desertification. Like in many other tropical and subtropical regions, most rural communities in Brazil's drylands are extremely poor, rely on subsistence farming - a vulnerable livelihood to climate change, and live in places where formal institutions are absent or fail to accomplish the role expected of them. Using case study analysis and evidence synthesis, I demonstrate that the transformative capacity of entrepreneurship, well-known in the social sciences but vastly overlooked in conservation science, is a key driverevelop courses for the Department of Biology through the lens of social justice
